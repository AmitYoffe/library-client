1) fix onChange reload of UI when adding / editing item
    -- check if this has something to do with staleTime of the data
    -- moving away from the page for a sec refreshes only the UI i need, this is the correct behavior i need. 
            I need to understand why and how does this functionality happen on chrome tab movements so i can implement it.

Stale queries are refetched automatically in the background when:
    # New instances of the query mount
    # The window is refocused
    # The network is reconnected
    # The query is optionally configured with a refetch interval 

I have a UI i am writing using react-query, and i am experiencing a weird behavior.
The UI doesnt always change on successful mutations or queries. I know they are succesful.
Sometimes they do change the UI, most of the time they don't, the change is inconsistent.
I also noticed that changing between tabs always refreshes the UI as i want it, is there a way to implement it in my app's logic?
So in conclusion, the data is fetched successfuly in all the different fecthes i make, but the UI sometimes uses the cached data,
and does not reupdate the UI even though a successful new stream of data came in.
