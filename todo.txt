3) make sure that the file locations and structure in general is correct 

4) -- find a way to use all colors in my theme, currently i use only some 

5) find mutual components:
    [ books/ writers grid containers ] , [ books/ writers Side Drawer ]

6) Backend change:
    Change the books count to not be a dynamic numebr that changes with every borrow or return, 
    make it a static number. When i will need to check the amount of books in stock, then i will calculate it rhough the borrows.
